<h1>Public Content Creation Examples for ChilloutVR</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ChilloutVR is a social VR game that allows players to create and share their own content, such as props and worlds. In this wiki page, we will show you some examples of public content creation that you can use as inspiration or reference for your own projects.</p>
<h2><br>Props</h2>
<p>Props are objects that you can spawn and interact with in the game. They can be anything from furniture, toys, weapons, vehicles, etc. You can create props using any 3D modeling software, such as Blender, Maya, or Unity. To upload your props to ChilloutVR, you need to use the ChilloutVR Content Creation Kit (CCK), which is a tool that helps you configure and optimize your props for the game. You can find more information about the CCK and how to use it <a href="https://wiki.chilloutvr.eu/en/prop/Prop">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some examples of props that have been created by the community are:</p>

<h2><br>Worlds</h2>
<p>Worlds are environments that you can explore and hang out in with other players. They can be realistic, fantasy, sci-fi, or anything in between. You can create worlds using the Unity game engine. To upload your worlds to ChilloutVR, you need to use the CCK as well, which helps you set up the lighting, audio, physics, and other features of your world. You can find more information about the CCK and how to use it <a href="https://wiki.chilloutvr.eu/en/worlds/worlds">here</a>.</p>
