<h2><br><strong><u>The Process:</u></strong></h2>
<p>ChilloutVR is a social VR game that allows you to create and customize your own virtual world and avatar. One of the features of ChilloutVR is the ability to upload your own props, which are 3D models that you can use in the game. Props can be anything from furniture, weapons, vehicles, animals, plants, and more. In this blog post, we will explain how to upload a prop to ChilloutVR in the style of a wiki page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span class="text-big"><u>Step 1: Prepare your prop</u></span></h3>
<p>Before you can upload your prop to ChilloutVR, you need to make sure that it meets the following requirements:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- The prop must be in FBX or OBJ format.</p>
<p>- The prop must have a collider and a rigidbody component.</p>
<p>- The prop should be scaled correctly and oriented with the positive Z axis pointing forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can use any 3D modeling software to create or edit your prop, such as Blender or Maya. Make sure to save your prop as a separate file and name it appropriately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span class="text-big"><u>Step 2: Upload your prop to ChilloutVR</u></span></h3>
<p>Once your prop is ready, you need to upload it to ChilloutVR using the Content Creator Kit (CCK). The CCK is a Unitypackage that allows you to upload content to ChilloutVR. To use the CCK, you need to have a ChilloutVR account and log in with your credentials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To upload your prop to ChilloutVR, follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- import the CCK into Unity.</p>
<p>- add the CVR Spawnable Component to the object you wanna upload.</p>
<p>- you can modify some properties in the Spawnable Component like permission, and you can enable the Advanced Settings to add synced Parameters.</p>
<p>- go to the CVR Control Panel menu.</p>
<p>- A window will pop up where you will then see a list of all the Props in your project. Select your Prop and click Upload.</p>
<p>- Wait for the CCK to process and validate your prop. This may take a few seconds depending on the size and complexity of your prop.</p>
<p>- If your prop passes the validation, you will see a preview of your prop and some options to edit its properties. You can change the name, description and tags of your prop.</p>
<p>- When you are satisfied with your prop settings, click on the Upload button. Your prop will be uploaded to ChilloutVR and added to your inventory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span class="text-big"><u>Step 3: Use your prop in ChilloutVR</u></span></h3>
<p>After uploading your prop to ChilloutVR, you can use it in the game. To use your prop in ChilloutVR, follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Launch ChilloutVR and log in with your account.</p>
<p>- Go to the World Browser and select a world that allows custom props.</p>
<p>- Enter the world and open your Menu.</p>
<p>- Go to the Props tab and find your uploaded prop. You can search for it by name or category.</p>
<p>- Select your prop and spawn it in front of you by pressing the “Drop Prop” Button. You can then grab it, throw it, or interact with it depending on its features.</p>
