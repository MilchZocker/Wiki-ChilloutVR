<h1><span class="text-huge"><strong><u>What is a World?</u></strong></span></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A World in ChilloutVR is a virtual environment that can be created, shared and explored by players and content creators. Worlds can have different themes, settings, features and game modes, depending on the creator's vision and skills. Worlds can be accessed through the World Browser or by joining friends or other players.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creating a World in ChilloutVR requires using the Unity-based Content Creation Kit (CCK), which can be downloaded from the Community Hub. The CCK allows creators to upload their own models, textures, sounds, animations and scripts to make their Worlds unique and interactive. Creators can also use templates and assets provided by the developers or other creators to get started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worlds in ChilloutVR can be public or private, depending on the creator's preferences. Public Worlds need to be approved by a staff member before they are visible on the World Browser. Private Worlds can only be accessed by invited players or friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worlds in ChilloutVR are an essential part of the game's social sandbox experience, as they enable players and creators to express themselves, have fun and discover new possibilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main component for a world in ChilloutVR is called CVR World. It is needed for uploading your world and contains settings such as Spawns, which are the transform position and rotation of the assigned game objects that will be used as spawn points for players. If there are no configured spawn points, the transform of the CVR World game object will be used instead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Safety and Content Control</h3>
<p>While ChilloutVR offers a wide range of experiences, it is important to note that some worlds may contain content that is not suitable for all audiences.</p>
<p>The platform provides options for users to toggle NSFW (not safe for work) content on or off, allowing individuals to customize their experience based on their preferences.</p>
<p>It is essential to exercise caution and adhere to community guidelines to ensure a safe and enjoyable environment for all users.</p>
