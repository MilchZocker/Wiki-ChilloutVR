<h1><strong><u>How to Upload a World to ChilloutVR</u></strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong><u>Requirements:</u></strong></h2>
<p>- The Correct Unity Version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- The CCK (ContentCreationKit)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>both can be found <a href="https://cck.cvr.gg/">here</a>:</p>
<p>https://cck.cvr.gg/</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong><u>Small Info:</u></strong></h2>
<p>(Here you can get your Content Creation Kit Master Key: https://hub.abinteractive.net/my)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(I recommend using Unity Hub especially if you require multiple Unity Versions.)</p>
<h2><br><strong><u>The Process:</u></strong></h2>
<p>1. Open your world project in Unity and import the ChilloutVR CCK package by going to Assets &gt; Import Package &gt; Custom Package and selecting the downloaded file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. In the Hierarchy window, create an empty game object and name it "CVR World". This will be the main component for your world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. In the Inspector window, add the CVR World script to the CVR World game object by clicking on Add Component and searching for CVR World. This script contains all the settings and options for your world, such as name, description, tags, image, spawn points, etc. You can find more information about each option on https://cck.cvr.gg/.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. In the Hierarchy window, create another empty game object and name it "CVR Spawn Point". This will be the default spawn point for your world, where players will appear when they join your world. &nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Move and rotate the CVR Spawn Point game object to where you want players to spawn in your world. You can use the Scene view or the Gizmos tool to adjust it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. If you want to add more spawn points to your world, you can repeat steps 5-6 for each spawn point. You can also assign different tags to each spawn point using the CVR Spawn Point script, which will allow you to control who can use them (for example, only friends or only admins).&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Save your scene and project in Unity by going to File &gt; Save Scene and File &gt; Save Project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. In the top menu bar of Unity, click on ChilloutVR &gt; Upload World. This will open a window where you can enter your API key and select your world scene file.</p>
<p>9. Enter your API key that you obtained from https://hub.abinteractive.net/my and click on Validate Key.</p>
<p>10. Click on Upload World. This will start the process of uploading your world to ChilloutVR servers. You will see a progress bar and some messages indicating the status of the upload.</p>
<p>11. Fill in the required fields in the Upload Panel, such as world name, description, image, etc. Make sure to follow the guidelines and requirements for each field.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>12. Once the upload is complete, you will see a message saying "World uploaded successfully". You can now close the window and exit Unity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>13. To test your world in ChilloutVR, launch the game from Steam and log in with your account. Go to Worlds &gt; My Worlds and select your world from the list. Click on Create Instance and choose a name and privacy option for your instance. Click on Join Instance and wait for the world to load.&nbsp;</p>
<p>14. Congratulations! You have successfully uploaded a world in ChilloutVR!</p>
