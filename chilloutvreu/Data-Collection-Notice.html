<p>Data Collection Notice for https://wiki.milchzocker.org</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This notice explains how we collect, use and protect your personal data when you visit our website. Personal data means any information that can identify you directly or indirectly, such as your name, email address, or IP address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We respect your privacy and we are committed to complying with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other relevant data protection laws.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What data do we collect and why?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We collect two types of data from you:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Data that you provide voluntarily when you register an account, such as your email address and password. We need this data to create and manage your account, to authenticate you when you log in, and to send you password reset emails if you request them.</p>
<p>- Data that we collect automatically when you visit our website, such as your IP address, browser type, device type, operating system, pages visited, time spent, and referral source. We only collect this data if you do not have a "Do Not Track!" request enabled in your browser settings. We use this data to improve our website performance, functionality and user experience, to measure and analyze our web traffic, and to understand our audience better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use a third-party service called Umami to collect and display the automatic data. You can view the data we collect publicly at <a href=" https://umami.milchzocker.org/share/hGbn4xvInf85uZgA/wiki.chilloutvr.eu">https://umami.milchzocker.org/share/hGbn4xvInf85uZgA/wiki.chilloutvr.eu</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do we protect your data?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration or destruction. We use encryption, firewalls, access controls and other security best practices to safeguard your data. We only store your data for as long as necessary for the purposes stated above or as required by law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are your rights?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict or object to the processing of your data, as well as the right to data portability and the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you believe that we have violated your data protection rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To exercise any of these rights, or if you have any questions or concerns about our data collection practices, please contact us at [email protected]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may update this notice from time to time to reflect changes in our data collection practices or legal obligations. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting a notice on our website or by email. We encourage you to review this notice periodically to stay informed about how we collect, use and protect your data.</p>
