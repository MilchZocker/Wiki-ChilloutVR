<h1>Magica Cloth 2 in CVR</h1>
<p>In this blog post, I will explain how to use Magica Cloth 2 on avatars in ChilloutVR. Magica Cloth is a Unity asset that allows you to create realistic cloth simulations for your characters, such as skirts, hair, capes, etc.</p>
<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>You will need Unity 2021.3.23f1, latest CCK, &nbsp;and the Magica Cloth 2 packages to follow this tutorial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Pre Setup</h2>
<p>First, &nbsp;Import your avatar model into Unity and set up the basic components such as Animator, Avatar Descriptor and Avatar Settings. Then import the Magica Cloth 2 package from the Package manager.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<h2><br><a href="https://magicasoft.jp/en/mc2_meshclothstartguide/">Magica Mesh Cloth</a></h2>
<p>When using Magica Mesh Cloth, you need to add the Magica Cloth component to your avatars mesh object. This component will create a virtual mesh that will be used for the cloth simulation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enter “Paint Mode”, you have to paint moving and Fixed parts for a simulation to work. If all points are marked as moving the mesh will fall indefinetly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select from one of the provided presets and check the result in Play mode, when you found one close to what you want to have you can start tweaking the settings more.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can add Magica Cloth Collider components to your avatar. This component will let you define colliders that will interact with the cloth simulation. those are often used on the Head for Hair to not clip inside. aswell as Leg and Hip.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><br><a href="https://magicasoft.jp/en/mc2_boneclothstartguide/">Magica Bone Cloth</a></h2>
<p>When using Magica Bone Cloth, you need to add the Magica Cloth component to your avatars Root Bone.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:50%;"><img src="/screenshot_2023-12-16_211834.png">

<p><br>Change the Cloth Type from “Mesh Cloth” to “Bone Cloth”.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:50.03%;"><img src="/screenshot_2023-12-16_212155.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select The Root Bones that should be influenced together.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:50.02%;"><img src="/screenshot_2023-12-16_212539.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Entering “Paint Mode” is not necessary if the default behavior of having the root bone static and the child bones moving is correct for the usecase. If all points are marked as moving the mesh will fall indefinetly.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:50.03%;"><img src="/screenshot_2023-12-16_212707.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select from one of the provided presets and check the result in Play mode, when you found one close to what you want to have you can start tweaking the settings more.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:50.05%;"><img src="/screenshot_2023-12-16_213437.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can add Magica Cloth Collider components to your avatar. This component will let you define colliders that will interact with the cloth simulation. those are often used on the Head for Hair to not clip inside. aswell as Leg and Hip.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Finishing</h2>
<p>That's it! You have successfully added Magica Cloth simulation to your avatar in chilloutvr. You can test your avatar in-game by uploading it using the CCK and selecting it in the Avatars Tab. You should see your cloth parts moving realistically with physics.</p>
