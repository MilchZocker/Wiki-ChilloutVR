<h2><br><strong><u>The Process:</u></strong></h2>
<p>ChilloutVR is a sandbox game that allows players to create and share their own content, including avatars. Avatars are 3D models that represent the player in the game world. In this post, we will show you how to upload your own avatar to ChilloutVR using the Content Creation Kit (CCK) and the references provided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 1. Download and install Unity 2019.4.31f1 LTS, which is the version compatible with ChilloutVR.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 2: Download and import the CCK package from <a href="https://cck.cvr.gg/">here.</a></h3>
<p>The CCK is a Unity-based tool that lets you create and upload game modes, worlds and avatars for ChilloutVR. You can download it from the documentation site at https://documentation.abinteractive.net/. You will need a ChilloutVR account and a valid login key to use the CCK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 3. Create a new Unity project and open it.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 4: Import your avatar model</h3>
<p>You can use any 3D model that is compatible with Unity as your avatar, as long as it meets the requirements and guidelines of ChilloutVR. You can also convert a VRChat avatar to ChilloutVR using a script that you can find at https://github.com/imagitama/vrc3cvr. To import your avatar model, open the CCK project in Unity and drag and drop your model file into the Assets folder. You can also use the Import New Asset option from the Assets menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 5: Configure your avatar settings</h3>
<p>After importing your avatar model, you need to configure some settings to make it work in ChilloutVR. Select your model in the Project window and go to the Inspector window. Add the CVRAvatar component to your model. This component contains various settings that affect how your avatar behaves in the game. You can find more details about each setting in the documentation site at https://documentation.abinteractive.net/.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the most important settings are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Avatar Blendshapes: A selection of visemes/blendshapes used for mouth and eye movements.</li>
  <li>Avatar View Position: The position of the camera relative to your avatar. You can adjust this by moving the CVR View Position object that is attached to your model.</li>
  <li>Avatar Advanced Settings: allows you to add configurable parameters to controll parts of your Avatar.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 6: Upload your avatar</h3>
<p>Once you have configured your avatar settings, you are ready to upload it to ChilloutVR. To do this, go to the CVR Control Panel menu and select Upload Content. A window will pop up where you will then see a list of all the avatars in your project. Select your avatar and click Upload. You will then see a summary of your avatar information and a preview of your icon. If everything looks good, click Upload.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your avatar will be uploaded to ChilloutVR's cloud server and will be available for you to use in the game. You can check the status of your upload on the community hub.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Congratulations! You have successfully uploaded your own avatar to ChilloutVR. You can now enjoy it with other players and explore endless worlds and game modes. Have fun!</p>
