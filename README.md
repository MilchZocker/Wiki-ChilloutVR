# ChilloutVR.eu Wiki

Welcome to the ChilloutVR.eu Wiki! This wiki is a bi-directional storage powered by Wiki.js, allowing users to directly contribute by creating pull requests. We have implemented this approach to ensure a smoother collaboration process, as Wiki.js does not currently provide an approving commits system. The ChilloutVR Wiki is provided by the Unofficial ChilloutVR Community (UCC). Join the ChilloutVR Discord community at [chilloutvr.eu](https://chilloutvr.eu) for more information and to connect with other users.
